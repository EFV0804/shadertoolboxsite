## Hello
My name is Elise, I make shaders, games and art. When I have time I make models and sculptures.

The goal of this website is to put most of my work in one place. There are shaders, and links to games I made or helped to make. 
I'm also working on a shader editing software for my own convenience. I'm trying to write about it to upload here. It might be a while.

Because I tend to forget things, and because it's nice, all the shader stuff is written in a sort of tutorial form. I try to add resources and useful information as well.

Here are the links to the various professional things I'm on:
