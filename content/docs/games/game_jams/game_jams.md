# Game Jams

Here are some of the games I helped make during game jams


## Rooting for you

A 2 player coop game made during the global game jam. I was in charge of making the cutout wall system, specifically the wall movement and the collision detection.

## The Great Puppini

A single player game about a magical dog who brings great joy to the humans by finding their lost belongings.
I was in charge of making the navigation system, the arrow pointing in the direction of the quest objective, and a minimap showing the position of quest givers and quest objects.

## This is fine 

A single player game about a cloud trying to prevent wild fires caused by cilamte change. I was in charge of making the cloud movement around the earth and the rain mechanism.
