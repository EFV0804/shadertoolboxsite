# Ressources
This page is a ressource dump where I keep links to every useful site, article, shader example and so on.

* [Alan Zucconi's website](https://www.alanzucconi.com/tutorials/) - A lot of good Unity shader tutorials
* [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - by [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/). It's one of the best ressource to begin shader editing.
* [Inigo Quilez's website](https://iquilezles.org/) - It's not as easy to get into as The Book of Shaders, but it has a lot of very good functions, tutorials, and articles.
* [The Art of Code channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheArtofCodeIsCool) - Some of us learn a lot better through video. He's uses ShaderToy so it's very easy to get up to speed and follow along.
